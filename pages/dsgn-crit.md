<h1> Design Criteria </h1>

<p> Based on the project's <a href="https://conrado-m-ucsd.github.io/SYN-100-Project/pages/motives.html"> motivations</a>, certain criteria guided the project. </p> 
<p>These criteria are: </p>

<ol> 
    <li> <h3>Our project must use common and accessible parts. </h3> </li>
    <li> <h3>The selected parts must be as affordable as possible, without compromising on functionality or rigidity. </h3> </li>
    <li> <h3>The project will be published under an open-source license. </h3></li> 
    <li> <h3>The platform created must be easily customizable. </h3></li>
</ol>

<p> With these considerations in mind, we got to work. Five weeks later, our project had concluded. In the end, we were able to produce <a href ="https://conrado-m-ucsd.github.io/SYN-100-Project/pages/result.html">a design</a> that satisfied these conditions. </p>
