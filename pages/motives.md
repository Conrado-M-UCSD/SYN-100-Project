<h1> Project Motivations </h1>

<p> 
This project was prompted by ever-increasing levels of pollution that plague coastlines around the world. These dire conditions inflict extensive harm on the wildlife and human activities in the region affected. 

Nonetheless, existing solutions have attempted to address the issue (such as [Bebot](https://searial-cleaners.com/bebot/) from company The Serial Cleaners). While we value these contributions, they leave behind unoccupied niches. Particularly, Bebot is primarily aimed towards and deployed at leisure locations (marinas, beach resorts, etc). Upon realizing this, the project's core motivation was formed: make an accessible solution, one that can be created and implemented by a much broader demographic, especially those in regions subjected to social, political, or economic instability. As these disadvantaged populations are likely to be disproportionately impacted, we felt accessibility was a feature we would be unwilling to compromise during the Coast Cleanup Cruiser's development. This (among other considerations) greatly influenced our project's <a href="dsgn-crit.html"> design criteria</a>.
