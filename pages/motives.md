<h1> Project Motivations </h1>

<p> 
This project was prompted by ever-increasing levels of pollution that plague coastlines around the world. These dire conditions inflict extensive harm on the wildlife and human activities in the region affected. 

Nonetheless, existing solutions have attempted to address the issue (such as [Bebot](https://searial-cleaners.com/bebot/) from the Serial Cleaners). While we value these contributions, they leave behind unoccupied niches. Particularly, Bebot is primarily aimed towards and deployed at leisure locations (marinas, beach resorts, etc).
