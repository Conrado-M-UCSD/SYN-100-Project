<p> The Coast Cleanup Cruiser is beach cleaning... reimagined! At its core, the Cruiser is an open-source design platform for autonomous beach cleaning robots. The complete design provided serves as an example of what's possible, but also leaves room for those building to make additions/modifications as needed.</p>

<p> 
This project was developed as part of UC San Diego's Synthesis 100 course. This course saw the four of us complete the design, compile a BOM, planning a coding outline, drafting accompanying documentation and webpage in a 5 week span during our Fall 2022 quarter. 
The supplied designs have been subitted for potential inclusion in the Synthesis Digital Collection. </p>
<p> If selected, this project will be added to the Digital Collection at some point in the second half of 2023. </p>
